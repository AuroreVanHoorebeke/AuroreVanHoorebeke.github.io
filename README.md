# Dev landing page

Hello everyone!

Here's the repository of [my very first page](https://aurorevanhoorebeke.github.io/) on the Internet.  
It was created using [flexdinesh's](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page#github-pages) minimalist Dev Landing Page.

It will be improved as I keep learning on my junior Web Dev journey.  
It's still the beginning, and I'm open to all suggestions!
